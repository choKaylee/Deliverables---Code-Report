# cse final project README file
### How to download the data used in this project?
> Assuming that the zipped dataset file is uploaded on gradescope, here is how to implement through each dataset.

* once you downloaded all the files from the zip file, open visual studio code or other tool to implement the code. If asked to open a folder, open the folder in the zip file named Final Project. The Final Project folder will be your directory. This contains our program and support files. 
* open the code file which contains cse163_utils.py, dataset.py, graphing.py, testing.py on you laptop.
* now it's time to download plotly library for visualization implementation.
* In your terminal, type in **pip install plotly** and the library will be dowloaded on your laptop.
* After you downloaded the plotly library, try running the code by hitting run button.

> If the zipped file doesn't contain datasets due to the size issue, here's how to download each dataset from the
link stated on the Deliverables - Code/Report.
Make sure all downloaded datasets are moved into the Final Project Folder.
**Cool visualizations will pop up on the laptop screen!**
